# Linux File System ðŸ˜…
The story began with the father of file system. `/` everything start with this tile sign. It is the root folder of the linux file system.
always search ```
```c
man hier
man hier | grep -i "<what you find>"
```

# /etc 
`/etc/passwd`
- Contains user account information.
- Each line represents a user on the system with fields like username, user ID, group ID, and home directory.
`/etc/shadow`
- Stores secure hashed passwords for users.
- Only accessible by the root user for security reasons.
 `/etc/fstab`
- Specifies disk drives and partitions that are mounted automatically at boot.
- Contains information about file systems, their mount points, and options like read/write permissions.
`/etc/hostname`
- Stores the name of the machine (hostname) which identifies the system on a network.
`/etc/hosts`
- Maps hostnames to IP addresses locally, useful for resolving network names before querying DNS.
 `/etc/network/`
- Contains network configuration files, including settings for network interfaces, static IPs, and DNS servers.
`/etc/apt/` (Debian/Ubuntu-based systems)
- Contains configuration files for the APT package management system.
- Includes sources for software repositories and package settings.
 `/etc/cron*`
- Stores configuration files for cron jobs, which are scheduled tasks that run at specified times or intervals.
`/etc/sysctl.conf`
- Contains kernel parameters that are applied at boot time. These parameters tune and configure kernel settings.
`/etc/resolv.conf`
- Contains information about DNS servers that the system uses to resolve domain names into IP addresses.
`/etc/sudoers`
- Specifies user permissions for the `sudo` command, determining who can run commands as root and what commands they can execute.
 `/etc/init.d/`
- Contains scripts to start, stop, and manage system services during boot, shutdown, or while the system is running. This has largely been replaced by `systemd` on modern distributions, but some scripts may still reside here.
`/etc/systemd/`
- Configuration files for `systemd`, the init system used to manage services, daemons, and system resources on most modern Linux distributions.
# /var
`/var/log/`
- Contains log files generated by the system and applications.
- System logs such as `syslog`, `auth.log`, and `kern.log` are stored here, providing information about system events, errors, and activities.
`/var/tmp/`
- Used for temporary files that need to persist between system reboots, unlike `/tmp` which is often cleared at reboot.
- Applications may use this directory for storing temporary data that doesnâ€™t require long-term storage.
`/var/lib/`
- Stores state information for applications and services.
- This can include databases, runtime data, and other persistent data required for programs to operate. For example, package management systems like `dpkg` and `apt` store metadata here (`/var/lib/dpkg/`, `/var/lib/apt/`).
`/var/spool/`
- Contains files waiting to be processed by services.
- For example, print jobs waiting to be sent to a printer may be stored in `/var/spool/cups`, while email messages waiting for transmission may be stored in `/var/spool/mail`.
`/var/cache/`
- Stores cached data for applications.
- This may include cached files downloaded by package managers like `apt`, web browsers, or other software that needs to temporarily store data to improve performance.
`/var/mail/`
- Stores local user mailboxes (traditional Unix mail storage).
- Incoming mail for local users can be found in this directory, although modern systems often use dedicated mail servers and different storage methods.
`/var/run/`
- Contains PID files and other runtime information for system processes and services.
- This directory is used for tracking services and daemons running on the system, with files typically listing the process IDs (PIDs) of running services.
`/var/lock/`
- Contains lock files to ensure that resources are accessed by only one process at a time.
- Lock files help prevent multiple processes from writing to the same file or device concurrently, avoiding conflicts and potential corruption.
`/var/www/`
- Default location for website files in web servers like Apache and Nginx.
- Contains the public HTML, PHP, and other resources that the web server serves to clients.
`/var/backups/`
- Used to store system backup files.
- Some system processes may create automatic backups in this directory to ensure important configuration files can be restored in case of failure.
`Also`
- `/var` holds dynamic files, log data, spools, and other system files that change frequently.
- It supports applications that require persistent runtime data, ensuring system services operate smoothly.

# /usr
`/usr/`
- The `/usr` directory contains user-related programs and data. It holds the majority of user-installed software, libraries, and read-only data.
`/usr/bin/`
- Contains binary executable files for most user commands and applications.
- Common programs like `ls`, `cp`, and `grep` are stored here, available for all users to execute.
`/usr/sbin/`
- Contains system administration binaries.
- Commands for superusers like `fdisk`, `ifconfig`, and other system management tools are stored here.
`/usr/lib/`
- Contains libraries needed by binaries in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.
- Includes shared libraries, modules, and dynamically loadable objects used by various applications.
`/usr/local/`
- Used for locally installed software, that is, software not managed by the system's package manager.
- Subdirectories like `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`, and `/usr/local/sbin` mirror the structure of `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, and `/usr/sbin`, but hold custom software installed by the user or administrator.
`/usr/share/`
- Contains architecture-independent data used by applications.
- This includes things like documentation, icons, fonts, and locale files.
`/usr/include/`
- Stores header files for programming languages like C and C++.
- These files are essential for software development and are included when compiling source code.
`/usr/src/`
- Contains the source code for applications, particularly the Linux kernel source.
- Useful for developers who need to build kernel modules or recompile the kernel.
`/usr/games/`
- Contains binaries for installed games.
- Typically used for lightweight games and utilities available on the system.
`/usr/libexec/`
- Stores small helper programs that are executed by other programs.
- These aren't typically executed directly by the user but are essential for various background services.
`Also`
- The `/usr` directory is a critical part of the Linux file hierarchy.
- It holds the system's user utilities, libraries, and shared files. Unlike `/bin` and `/sbin`, `/usr` generally contains larger, non-essential utilities.
